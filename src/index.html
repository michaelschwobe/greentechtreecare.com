          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Plant Health Care</h2>
          <p>
            In an urban setting it may be difficult to maintain healthy trees.
            Insect and disease problems in most cases are due to a trees
            inability to fight off the problem on its own. Diagnosing and
            treating the problem, not the affect is the key to keeping your
            trees and shrubs healthy. The tree care industry has made
            advancement in the way trees can be treated. Many of which avoid
            spraying chemicals into the air that can drift off target. At Green
            Tech, we only use these advanced application techniques’ in our
            treatments. They have had proven results as well as the smallest
            impact on the environment the industry has to offer.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Pruning</h2>
          <p>
            As trees grow, they need direction. This can be accomplished through
            many types of pruning techniques. Specialized training and
            equipment, as well as an eye for what really needs to be done are
            the tools that we use to complete our work. Pruning trees not only
            enhances the appearance of your landscape, it helps to maintain its
            health and vitality. Pruning Services we provide:

          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Removal</h2>
          <p>
            Removing a tree on your property may become necessary for a variety
            of reasons. Do to the sheer size or location of a tree, its removal
            may be dangerous, involve large equipment, and take a great deal of
            time. We will discuss with you in detail what we will be doing to
            remove your tree as well as keep the rest of your landscape from
            being damaged in the process. This allows the homeowner to be
            involved in the planning and have full knowledge of the operation at
            hand.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Stump Grinding</h2>
          <p>
            Stumps left from removed trees can be unsightly and hazardous. We
            will grind out any stump to a depth of ten to twelve inches below
            grade, unless a utility or fixed object stands in the way. By
            Wisconsin state law Digger’s Hotline will be contacted by us prior
            to any bellow ground work on a client’s property. As always, we
            strive to meet the needs of our clients by providing a service that
            includes the complete removal of a stump as well as filling the hole
            with top soil, applying grass seed and starter fertilizer as needed.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Support Systems</h2>
          <p>
            Removing a tree that you value do to structural defects is not the
            only option available. A tree that has an elevated risk of failure
            can have a support system installed. When assessed and installed
            correctly, these cables and braces aid in reducing the potential of
            failure and can extend the life of a tree. Be aware that it is an
            industry standard to have a tree pruned prior to any support system
            being installed and such will be advised to you by our arborist.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Storm Damage &amp; Wound Tracing</h2>
          <p>
            When trees become damaged or fail completely due to wind, ice, snow,
            lightening or construction, they will most likely need immediate
            attention due to the hazards they create. Our staff is experienced
            in safely removing large limbs or whole trees under these dangerous
            conditions as well as repairing the wounds that damaged trees have
            sustained.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section__subtitle">Tree Planting</h2>
          <p>

            assist you with selecting new tree’s that fits your needs as well as
